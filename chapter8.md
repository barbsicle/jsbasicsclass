# Chapter 8 - Some Afterthoughts

## On the DOM

* The DOM is a very outdated, messy model
* However, it is the base of all html and js and so we'll need to learn some of it
* It is very powerful and can still be use to intervene in some case
* However, nowadays to fulfil a lot of these oft-desired functions (like displaying lists), we use frameworks

------

## Frameworks

* The next step in web development is likely to learn a framework
* A framework helps give your code structure and to follow best practices
* It also gives you many helper functions to generate dynamic DOM elements easily
* Frameworks are opinionated, meaning the developers think that the best way to code some of your code is x
* I did not go through frameworks because
    * They are opinionated, and I am just here to teach the basics
    * They are complex to learn at the start
* Nevertheless, most people will end up working with frameworks
* Some front-end frameworks I would recommend are Angular2 and React (there is also jQuery, which is getting old)

------

## HTML/CSS

* This was a very bare-bones exercise focusing on JS
* To make your app look beautiful, you need more in-depth knowledge on HTML/CSS
* Resources on HTML/CSS are plentiful, can learn on-the-job
* There are also libraries of templates/boilerplates that are great to start with already

------

## On Learning

* It is probable that you will not remember 80% of the functions we mentioned
* This is to be expected
* Languages are called languages because they require regular use
* Over time if you keep working at it, it will be second nature to you
* Do not be afraid to google for what you need (in fact, googling is the most important skill)
* Refer to various resources (MDN, W3Schools) to get your functions

* Nevertheless, this was a good exercise in logic
* If you don't continue down the road of intensive programming, you can at least take this mindset and apply it to daily problem solving
